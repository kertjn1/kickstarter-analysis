# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

**Overview of the Project:**
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the outcomes of plays based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

**Analysis and Challenges:**
The data source for this project is an Excel spreadsheet with compiled data points.  To complete this analysis two methods were utilized. 
For the launch date-based outcomes I used the pivot table to analyze the results of all plays by months.  Additionally, to help visualize the trend of the outcomes, a line graph was added to accompany the pivot table.  To allow for flexibility of future analyses I included filters for the Parent Category of all other projects and calendar years.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101417142/165096822-99ea2ae7-f4ce-4058-80a0-afa2858a4593.png)
For the outcomes of all plays based on funding goals I created a table with ranges of funding targets and their corresponding results.  The Excel formulas that I used to complete this analysis were COUNTIFS(=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<=4999",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays")), SUM(=SUM(B3:D3)), and basic math equation(=B3/E3) to carry out the division between cells to yield percentage rates.  A line graph was also added to help visualize the trend of the outcomes by percentage.
The key challenge that I faced during this exercise was remembering to lock the columns (fn + F4) prior to copying/pasting formulas to other cells.  Without locking the columns, such as the Subcategory (Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays"), the formulas will return inaccurate data because Excel will continually utilize the next adjacent column for its calculation.

**Results:**
The Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The data reveal that, by numbers, May is best month to launch a play.  However, May also represents the month with the highest number of failed plays.  If we were to look at the percentage of successful plays (and failures) by months the results are not hugely different.
Outcomes Based on Goals
By percentage, which is shown in the line graph, plays in the lower range of funding targets have the highest rate of success (Less than 100 up to 4999).

**Summary of Limitations**
The key limitation of both analyses is that weâ€™re not looking at enough data points to make an accurate assessment.  For outcomes by launch date a close comparison of successes and failures against the total number of plays (% comparison) launched by month can provide a clearer picture.  
Additionally, successes and failures are measured by the amount of funding.  It would be helpful to have data on revenue generated by each play.  In Outcomes Based on Goals a large majority of successful plays were in the goal range of <1000 to 49999.  However, if those few successful plays in the higher goal range had brought in significantly more revenue then it could impact future strategic decisions.
